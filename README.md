## README

# Solar System Generator

This is the rails API for my first vanilla javascript project, frontend found here: https://github.com/SLarkworthy/solar_system_maker_frontend

# DESCRIPTION
hosted here: https://solar-system-generator.netlify.app/

Together with the front end, this project allows a user to make up a fake solar system and see a visual interactive image of it. A user creates a solar system with a name, followed by a sun with a spectral type desciption that changes its appearance. Then, a user can design 1-5 planets with attributes like name, composition, size, and whether or not it has rings. When all planets are designed, the final image appears. A user can also view and interact with other users' solar systems.
